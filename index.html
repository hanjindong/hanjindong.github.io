<td align="left"><p>I am currently an Associate Professor at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Shandong University. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2025. My research focuses on spatio-temporal intelligence, with the goal of building strong foundation models that can perceive, model, and reason about the ever-changing physical world. I have published over 20 papers in premier venues of data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, including IEEE TKDE, KDD, WWW, VLDB, AAAI, and IJCAI. Recently, I am particularly interested in developing spatio-temporal AI agents for applications in intelligent transportation, smart cities, and scientific discovery.</p>
<p>I am looking for highly motivated students and research assistants. If you are interested in my research, please send me an email.</p>
