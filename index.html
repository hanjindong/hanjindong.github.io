<td align="left"><p>I am currently an Associate Professor at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Shandong University. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2025. My research interests span a broad range of topics in data intelligence, including data mining, data-centric AI, and LLM agents. I have published over 20 papers in premier venues of data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, including IEEE TKDE, KDD, WWW, VLDB, NeurIPS, AAAI, and IJCAI. Recently, I am particularly interested in developing spatio-temporal AI agents for applications in intelligent transportation, smart cities, and scientific discovery.</p>
<p>I am looking for self-motivated students (Ph.D. students, Master students, and Interns), please feel free to contact!</p>
